# MyTorch CMU 11-785

This repository contains several Numpy-based deep learning implementation from the assignments of [CMU 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F22/index.html). The project follows a standard Python project structure on GitHub, complete with unit tests derived from the provided public autograder, with handout detail as follows:

- HW1P1 ([F22](https://github.com/CMU-IDeeL/CMU-IDeeL.github.io/tree/master/F22/document/homework/HW1) + [F23](https://github.com/CMU-IDeeL/CMU-IDeeL.github.io/tree/master/F23/document/homework/HW1)): A simple MLP from scratch. Additional activation functions were added based on F23.
- HW1P1 Bonus ([F22](https://github.com/CMU-IDeeL/CMU-IDeeL.github.io/tree/master/F22/document/homework/HW1)): Adam (with and without weight decay) optimizer and dropout regulatization.

## Environment

The code has been tested on Python 3.11.5 using Miniconda package manager. Refer to `requirements.txt` for minimum package requirements.
